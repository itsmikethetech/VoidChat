Ajchat - Install
================

Before you attempt to install Ajchat, please make sure you have met the following requirements.

Requirements:
  	PHP 4.3.1 or later
    MySQL 4.0 or later
    Apache HTTP Server 1.3 or later with 'mod_rewrite' module (otherwise, read the 'Notes' section below)
    A web-browser
    	
    	
Instructions:
	1. Configure 'includes/config_vars.inc.php'
	2. Make sure the folder 'chatdata' is writable (chmod 777)
	3. Import the data in 'ajchat.sql' to your database (make sure you have created the database first!)
	4. Check that you have the file '.htaccess' in your 'ajchat' directory and also in 'ajchat/chatdata' directory.
	   Make sure your .htaccess permissions are correct in your Apache config file, so that you can use mod_rewrite (the default configuration may not allow you to run directives for .htaccess).
	5. Do a test run on your web browser.
	
	
Notes:
	- For more creative ways of manupilating URLs without 'mod_rewrite', read
	  http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Rewrite_rules
	- If you encounter any 'HTTP Error 500 - Internal server error' errors while trying to run Ajchat after installation, check the '.htaccess' file for any problems or incompatibility. 
	- Make sure that your web server can store sessions data.
	- You can easily set the path for sessions with a .htaccess file with the following line below
	  php_value session.save_path path/to/session
	  But make sure your session data is NOT viewable to the public!
	- You need a really good server to run Ajchat if there are many users. Also, make sure your 'mysql max connections' for your MySQL settings (in your 'my.cnf') is high enough.
	- If you encounter "Fatal error: Call to undefined function getmxrr() in includes\functions_acc.inc.php", then you are running Windows. Go to the file and edit accordingly (Instructions in the file itself).
